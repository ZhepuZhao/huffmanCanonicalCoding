# huffmanCanonicalCoding
## Introduction
This project is the assignment of COMP 590 Data Compression at UNC-CH.
It's aiming at constructing Huffman Canonical Tree to decode and encode text file.
## Structure 
The `src` packages has the following four packages:
- `io`: to read and write any number of bits `Copyright 2019 by Aaron Smith`
- `huffmanDecoder`: helper classes like Cell, Node, and decoder class
- `huffmanEncoder`: encoder class
- `main`: run the Java application

The `data` package contains input and output files.
